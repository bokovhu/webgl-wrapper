# WebGL Wrapper

This project contains a simple wrapper for WebGL 2. It has basic
utility classes for shader compilation, shader programs, textures,
and framebuffers. You are free to use it in any project, be it
open-source or commercial, as long as you include a copy of the
license of the project with your software distribution.

## TODO

* Support uniform blocks
* Support for vertex transform feedback
* Support for pipelines, techniques (higher-level abstraction)
* glTF support
